      <p>
        Donation Hub is a platform to bring different non-profits organizations
        and donors together. It is a common issue that donations are not
        efficiently distributed and used. On Donation Hub, all different
        non-profits can easily create posts for donations that are in need or
        for surplus donations. By sharing surplus donations, donations resources
        can be shared with others so can be used efficiently. It also prevents
        possible food waste. It is also helping donors to find what to donate as
        well as the right organizations to donate. I hope you will enjoy
        Donation Hub and will find it useful. Happy sharing and happy donating!
